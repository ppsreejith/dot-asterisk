"Shipping beats perfection"

I've decided to start writing again. It may not be perfect but I think the habit of penning down, distilling, and sharing thoughts is a valuable exercise.

One big influence is the book [How to Take Smart Notes](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/34507927) by Sonke Ahrens. As the book suggests, writing is thinking. I'd been taking and [sharing](https://notes.ppsreejith.net) notes regularly on the content I consume. Compiling and sharing these notes is the next step.

These notes should allow me to keep a list of ideas handy. My current strategy is to pick topics from these notes that excite me the most. I hope that excitement as metric will motivate me to continue writing, keep my articles interesting, and act as a north start when deciding what to write about.

I'll probably start with book reviews, publishing them here and on my [goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20228885-sreejith-puthanpurayil) page. I've built a backlog of books I haven't updated yet. This should be a convenient starting point.

As always, time will tell and reality will be the judge.
