## Review {#review}

[The Black Swan](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/242472.The%5FBlack%5FSwan)

I've always struggled with reading a book that a lot of people constantly talk about. Especially working at GoJek where a lot of people use vocabulary from this book. I'm a bit rebellious that way. About a week ago, I finally got to reading this.

The Black Swan is definitely a perspective changing book introducing a lot of fresh, powerful ideas and discusses the _nature_ of uncertainty and the limits of knowledge i.e the unknown unknowns. It explains why predicting the future is a fundamentally hard problem and why projects with long timelines have to grapple with the unknown unknowns. Especially when living in a world containing millions of independent-decision making actors. Two actionable strategies which I've found interesting from this book include keeping shorter timelines and the barbell investment strategy.
